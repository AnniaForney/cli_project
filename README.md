# CliProject

Welcome to my CLI project! I decide to scrape from a crystal website to share my passion for collecting and learning about crystals. In my program you'll be able to learn more about crystals but using the search ahead feature. The search ahead feature will allow you input a letter in the terminal which will give you a list of crystals that start with the letter you have entered. I hope you enjoy my program and learn something new. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cli_project'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cli_project

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
